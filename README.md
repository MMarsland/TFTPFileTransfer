# TFTPFileTransfer
A TFTP File Transfer System for SYSC 3303.

As part of the SYSC 3303 course requirements we created a terminal application implementing the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) between a host and client computers in the lab.

The project was a fantastic success and acounted for error modes, poor use and network issues. No demo is currently avaliable.
